## ‚ùì Tokenomics FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How are CTN rewards calculated?</strong></summary>
<div>
Rewards are calculated based on multiple factors: GPU performance, uptime, network demand, staking multipliers, and reputation score. The base formula is: <code>Hourly CTN = Base Rate √ó GPU Performance √ó Uptime √ó Reputation √ó Staking Multiplier</code>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I lose my staked CTN tokens?</strong></summary>
<div>
Staked tokens can be slashed (partially lost) only if you engage in malicious behavior like submitting false computations or attempting to attack the network. Normal operation and honest mistakes do not result in slashing.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does governance voting work?</strong></summary>
<div>
Token holders can vote on proposals using their CTN tokens. Voting power is proportional to tokens held, but there are mechanisms to prevent whale dominance, including quadratic voting for certain proposal types and delegation systems.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I want to sell my CTN tokens?</strong></summary>
<div>
CTN tokens are freely tradeable on supported exchanges. However, staked tokens have unlock periods, and some governance positions may require minimum holding periods. Check the specific terms for your situation.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does CoTrain prevent token price manipulation?</strong></summary>
<div>
We use multiple mechanisms: algorithmic market making, treasury-managed stability funds, transparent on-chain governance, and economic incentives that align long-term value creation with token price appreciation.
</div>
</details>

## üß† Economic Philosophy

> *"True decentralization requires not just distributed infrastructure, but distributed ownership and governance. The CTN token ensures that those who contribute to the network's success share in its rewards, and those who use the network have a voice in its future."*

CoTrain's tokenomics are designed around core principles:

- **ü§ù Fairness**: Rewards proportional to contribution
- **üåç Accessibility**: Low barriers to participation
- **üîÑ Sustainability**: Long-term economic viability
- **üó≥Ô∏è Democracy**: Community-driven decision making
- **üîí Security**: Robust protection against attacks
