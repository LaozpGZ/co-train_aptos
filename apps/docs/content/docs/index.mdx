# The Dawn of Collaborative AI: CoTrain

There was a time, not so long ago, when the frontier of artificial intelligence felt within reach of a dedicated individual. A researcher in their home lab, armed with a powerful workstation and a spark of ingenuity, could train a model that would redefine the state-of-the-art. The legendary AlexNet, which revolutionized computer vision, was born from a five-day training session on a pair of gaming GPUs.

Today, in mid-2025, that landscape is virtually unrecognizable. The behemoth models that now dominate the AI world, with their trillions of parameters, demand a colossal toll in resources. Training a successor to GPT-4 or a leading multimodal agent is a multi-million dollar endeavor, consuming tens of thousands of specialized accelerator-days and megawatts of power. This new reality has, for many, relegated the dream of building truly cutting-edge AI to the exclusive domain of tech giants and national laboratories. The barrier to entry seems insurmountably high, threatening to stifle the diverse wellspring of innovation that has historically driven our field forward.

But what if the spirit of the individual creator is not a relic of a bygone era? What if the future of AI is not one of centralization, but of radical collaboration?

**We believe it is. And we are building that future with CoTrain.**

## What is CoTrain?

CoTrain is a testament to the idea that the collective power of a motivated community can rival that of any single institution. We are a **decentralized platform** that pools the computational resources of individuals and organizations across the globe, creating a distributed supercomputer for training massive language models. By joining our network, your GPU—whether it's one or one hundred—becomes part of a global effort to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence.
