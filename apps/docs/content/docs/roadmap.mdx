# 🚀 CoTrain Roadmap & Vision

CoTrain is building the next-generation AI training network — open, decentralized, and community-owned — powered by Aptos blockchain and the CTN token.

---

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision

We envision a world where:

- 🧠 **Training large models is accessible to everyone** — Not just tech giants, but researchers, startups, and individuals worldwide
- 🌐 **GPU power is pooled from individuals** — Your gaming rig can contribute to training the next breakthrough AI model
- 🔗 **Blockchain enforces fair payment and verification** — Transparent, trustless rewards for computational contributions
- 🗳️ **Model upgrades and ecosystem parameters are governed by DAO** — Community-driven decisions shape the platform's future
- 🤝 **Collaborative AI development becomes the norm** — Open science and shared innovation drive progress

Together, we'll democratize AI and ensure its benefits reach everyone.
