# 🧬 Decentralized Storage with Aptos & Shelby

In CoTrain, we believe that **data provenance, integrity, and accessibility** are essential pillars of decentralized AI development. To achieve this, we leverage the **Aptos blockchain's native storage features** and the powerful capabilities introduced in [Shelby](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/shelby-a-new-era-of-value-creation-for-web3), a new decentralized object storage framework launched by Aptos Foundation.

## 🛠️ Why Chain Storage for AI?

AI development traditionally relies on centralized cloud storage. CoTrain moves away from this model and instead:

- Publishes model checkpoints and hashes **on-chain**.
- Stores metadata and integrity proofs directly in **Move modules**.
- Distributes datasets via **content-addressed references**.
- Ensures verifiable and reproducible model builds via **chain commits**.

---

## 🔐 Enter Shelby: Decentralized Object Layer

### What is Shelby?

Shelby is a decentralized object storage protocol on Aptos that enables storing **large blobs**, including AI models and datasets, in a **secure, composable, and chain-native** manner.

Features we use:

- 🧾 **Immutable Object Publishing**: AI models are published with signatures and timestamps.
- 🔎 **Zero-Knowledge Integrity**: Dataset authenticity can be verified via ZK proofs.
- 📦 **Compression-aware Streaming**: Faster model delivery to GPU nodes via partial range fetch.
- 🌍 **Content Replication**: Nodes cache objects locally while maintaining canonical roots.

## 📦 CoTrain Storage Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Local Contributor] -->|Upload Dataset| B[Object Uploader]
  B -->|Store CID + Metadata| C[Shelby Storage Module (on Aptos)]
  C -->|Publish Event| D[Smart Contract Listener]
  D -->|Trigger| E[GPU Node Training]
  E -->|Write Checkpoint CID| C
  C -->|Expose State| F[Frontend/API/SDK]
```

> Every model checkpoint and dataset version is linked by a CID and published immutably via Aptos Move modules.

---

## 🔗 Sample On-chain Metadata Format (Move Struct)

```move
struct ModelInfo has key, store {
    cid: vector<u8>,
    owner: address,
    version: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    size_bytes: u64,
    integrity_hash: vector<u8>,
}
```

These structs are emitted as `resource` types and updated through permissioned modules. Contributors and verifiers can fetch this data through CoTrain SDK or directly via Aptos indexers.

---

## 🌐 SDK Usage Example

```python
from cotrain_sdk import ModelStorage

model = ModelStorage(model_id="llama2-42b")

metadata = model.fetch_onchain_metadata()
print("CID:", metadata.cid)
print("Integrity Hash:", metadata.integrity_hash)
print("Uploaded by:", metadata.owner)
```
