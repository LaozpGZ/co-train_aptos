# 🧠 CoTrain API Reference

This API allows you to query:

- 👤 Training contribution of a specific user (by wallet address)
- 🧪 Real-time progress of a model training job (by model ID)

All endpoints return JSON and are accessible via `https://api.cotrain.network/v1`.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header for authenticated endpoints:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

| wallet_address | string | ✅ Yes   | Aptos wallet address of user     |

### 📥 Request

```http
GET /users/0xabc123.../contribution
Host: api.cotrain.network
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### 📤 Response

```json
{
  "wallet_address": "0xabc123...",
  "total_gpu_hours": 128.5,
  "jobs_completed": 42,
  "ctn_earned": 962.75,
  "ranking_percentile": 0.12
}
```

## 🚧 Get Model Training Progress

### `GET /models/{model_id}/progress`

Returns the training progress of a model, including training phase, percent completion, total compute contributed, and contributors list.

### 🔧 Parameters

| Name      | Type   | Required | Description       |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| model_id  | string | ✅ Yes   | ID of the model   |

### 📥 Request

```http
GET /models/llama2-42b/progress
Host: api.cotrain.network
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### 📤 Response

```json
{
  "model_id": "llama2-42b",
  "status": "training",
  "percent_complete": 73.4,
  "estimated_completion_time": "2025-07-28T12:00:00Z",
  "total_gpu_hours": 18422.3,
  "contributors": [
    { "wallet": "0xabc123...", "gpu_hours": 152.5 },
    { "wallet": "0xdef456...", "gpu_hours": 87.3 }
  ]
}
```

## 📈 Example Integration in Python

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your-api-key"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

# Query user contribution
wallet = "0xabc123..."
resp = requests.get(f"https://api.cotrain.network/v1/users/{wallet}/contribution", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())

# Query model training progress
model_id = "llama2-42b"
resp = requests.get(f"https://api.cotrain.network/v1/models/{model_id}/progress", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```

## 📘 Notes

- Response values may be cached for a few seconds to reduce load.
- Model `status` can be: `"pending"`, `"training"`, `"completed"`, or `"failed"`.
- Percentile ranking is based on GPU hours across the network.

---

## 🧩 Coming Soon

- `/models` listing API
- `/jobs` historical activity API
- Webhook subscription for job completion events
