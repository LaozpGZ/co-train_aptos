# 🚀 CoTrain Roadmap & Vision

CoTrain is building the next-generation AI training network — open, decentralized, and community-owned — powered by Aptos and the CTN token.

---

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision

We envision a world where:

- 🧠 Training large models is accessible to everyone  
- 🌐 GPU power is pooled from individuals, not just corporations  
- 🔗 Blockchain enforces fair payment, verification, and rewards  
- 🗳️ Model upgrades and ecosystem parameters are governed by DAO  

Together, we’ll democratize AI.
